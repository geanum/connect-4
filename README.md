# Connect Four
Connect Four built in React

https://geanum.github.io/connect-4/

## Running the Application
Anything above Node 6 should let you build and run the application (I used Node 10).

In the applications directory, run these commands to get the app running on localhost:3000.
```
npm install
npm run start
```

(This application was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)

## Features
- All basic Connect 4 functionality
- Customizable player names
- Smooth UI and animations
